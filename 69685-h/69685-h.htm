<p class="drop-cap">BATHED in the sunshine of one of
those perfect days which so often come
with Christmas in the South, he stood
at the street corner, a light cane across his
shoulders supporting his gloved hands, his
eyes shifting with ever-changing interest, and
a half smile on his swarthy face. It was
written all over him that he had no appointments
to meet, no duties to discharge; that he
was by chance, only, in the moving picture and
not of the cast, and that the whole thing, so
far as he was concerned, was but a transient
show to be enjoyed for its brilliancy of colors
and its endless succession of fine Southern
faces.</p>

<p>But here was idleness without inertia.
Clearly he was one of those rare beings who
can radiate energy standing still and convey
the impression of impetuous force without
motion, a trick of the eyes, a refusal to sag.</p>

<p>Name? Ladies and gentlemen, meet King
Dubignon.</p>

<p>King saw her first as she started across
Cherry Street from the far corner, a slender
figure moving with grace and assurance
through the dangerous procession of motor
cars, still handled in the South as new toys,
and once or twice his lips parted for a warning
cry, but she gained the opposite corner
with ease and turned straight toward him
across Third. Now, of all the throng his
alert eyes clung to this approaching figure and
began to take note of details—white spats,
plain tailor suit, loose blousy waist and flat
hat with its little veil of black lace. Soon she
was directly in front but her demure gaze was
not for him. She was mentally preoccupied.
She had thoughts of her own and not having
seen the Dubignon eyes and smile she failed
to look back after she passed.</p>

<p>The young man released a suspended
breath like unto the fervid sigh of a cow settling
down to rest, lowered his cane and stood
gazing after the receding figure. And not he
only, as he noticed with quick jealousy. Every
man and woman who met her turned for a
second glance. The gentian eyes, radiant face,
curved lips parted in a half smile, belonged in
an artist’s dream; the slender, supple figure
borne along on dainty feet, the subtle grace of
her moving, line vanishing into line, curve
melting into curve, the free, elastic, boyish
stride, were combinations notable even in The
City of Beautiful Women, as the aborigines
call their Macon.</p>

<p>King was an artist and had dreamed. He
had lost something out of his dreams and now
he had found something to place in one. He
followed and saw her vanish into the crowd
of a cheap store, an emporium of ten-cent
things; and presently his broad shoulders
opened up a path there for himself. Down
one aisle and up another; and then he found
her. She was critically examining lace at ten
cents the yard and did not look up as he
passed. The purchase of lace of any kind is
a tax on all the faculties if one is faithful.</p>

<p>Checkmate? No. Inspiration! He went
forward to the turn of the aisle at the show
window near the door. It had occurred to
him that sooner or later she would pass out.
He took his stand in a little bay of space
nearby and waited. Time was no object to
him at such a crisis.</p>

<p>When he saw her coming again, threading
her way through the crowd and almost without
contact, he so maneuvered that she drifted
naturally into the little bay promptly vacated
for her accommodation. Instantly he was
standing directly in front, hat in hand, arresting
her departure:</p>

<p>“Beautiful, just a moment, please,” he said,
smiling down, “I saw you crossing the street
and followed you here. When you leave I
shall not follow again. Listen; what I am
asking is that you will take my card and have
your father, or somebody, inquire about me
of one of the bank cashiers on the corner, and
then write me your address, won’t you? This
isn’t regular, I know,” he continued with increase
of vocal momentum, “but it is necessary—absolutely
necessary. I have searched
and waited for you all my life, and if I lose
you now it may be forever.” The girl had
drawn back a little and was looking into his
face with wonder but without alarm. The
Dubignon eyes and smile were irresistible.
Nevertheless, now that he had spoken—words
altogether different from the formal
ones planned—King became self-conscious
and troubled. Something jarred. Perhaps it
was the twentieth century or the ten-cent store.
Besides, he was pointing a piece of cardboard
at her in, what must have seemed, a very absurd
way. She felt instantly his embarrassment,
and women of all ages gain composure
when men in their presence lose it. The instinctive
response of eyes and lips, vibrant
life to impetuous youth, was checked and a
tiny, perpendicular line divided her brows:</p>

<p>“Are you quite sane?” she began, her voice
reduced almost to a whisper—he thanked
God for that. “Stand aside, please, or shall
I send for the manager?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly sane,” he said, moving aside,
but still holding out the card. “You will not
send for anyone, because now the way is open.
But all the same, I wish, awfully, you would
take my card and when you get home decide.
Won’t you, please? It’s just a little, lonesome
card,” he added, whimsically. The girl hesitated,
questioning him with the wonderful
gentian eyes, into which, now of a sudden,
came a fixed light. A white wonder paled her
face for a fleeting instant, and she moved a
step nearer. Doubtingly, the gesture clearly
an unconscious one, her hand touched his arm.</p>

<p>“Have I ever seen you before? Do you
know my name?” He shook his head, smiling
happily. She watched the smile with open
interest.</p>

<p>“Think again!” she urged, earnestly. He
was deeply troubled. He wished that he
might say he had met her as a summer girl
somewhere, but he could not. What he did
say was:</p>

<p>“It may strike you as absurd, but I have
only seen you in a dream—a long dream!”
She smiled over this and with sudden decision
took the card, dropping it into her shopping
bag.</p>

<p>“You are not to follow. You promised!”</p>

<p>“Cross my heart! I shall remain here fifteen
minutes. Can you vanish back into your
sunbeam in fifteen minutes?”</p>

<p>“Completely.” Her little laugh was the
finest thing he had ever heard. She smiled up
into his face and passed out.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, having, with the aid
of a little lady of blonde accomplishments,
selected a dozen pairs of crimson and green
socks and paid for them, he looked at his
watch.</p>

<p>“My dear,” he said, “I’ve changed my
mind. There’s really no room in my grip for
this bundle. Christmas is at hand—kindly
hand them to Mother, with my best wishes.”</p>

<p>“And I have no mother, and I never saw
him before!” she said to the floorwalker, hysterically.
“And red and green socks!”</p>

<p>“Easy mash,” he laughed, “he’ll be back.
Exchange for something else.” She opened a
tiny vanity box and powdered her nose. It
was ammunition wasted.</p>

<p>Fate is a merry jade, at times. Half way
to Jacksonville in a Pullman next day a young
woman with gentian eyes, who had time and
again searched her handbag, opened a package
of cheap lace to finish dressing a Christmas
doll, and a card dropped out. It bore
the inscription, “King Dubignon.” Underneath
was penciled the information that he
was associated with Beeker, Toomer &amp;
Church, Architects, New York, and to this
was added, “Hotel Dempsey, Macon, three
days.” Fate’s little jest was the concealment
of the card in a fold of the paper wrapper for
twenty-four hours.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter II</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN King Dubignon left Cornell
and some seven hundred who had
labored with him through several
years of architecture and watercolor, he bore
with him the consciousness that final examples
of his work, left there, had not been excelled,
and the memory of many friendly assurances
that his place was waiting for him out in the
great world. That he construed these assurances
too literally was the fault of his temperament,
and so, perfectly natural. Home
yearning pulled him back to his beloved South
for the initial plunge, and it was not long before
his name in gilt invited the confidence of
the good people of Macon, who had castles
in the air.</p>

<p>The field proved narrow and depressing
for one of his profession and temperament.
The seven-room cottage of many colors
seemed the limit of popular imagination at
that time.</p>

<p>This, for a young man who was bursting
with ideas, and who dreamed of thirty-live
story buildings and marble palaces printing
graceful lines against skies of blue! The years
that slipped held some minor triumphs, but he
classed them as time wasted.</p>

<p>Then a provincial board turned down his
modern school building for a combination
barn, silo and garage, designed by somebody’s
nephew, and the proverbial straw was
on the celebrated camel’s back.</p>

<p>It was a spring day when the camel’s spine
collapsed. Birds were building homes for
themselves, and wonderful flowers were solving,
without human aid, marvels of form and
color, and voices were calling to him across
years unborn. Ah, those voices! He placed
a foot under the corner of his drawing table
and wrecked it against the wall.</p>

<p>Three days later he was in New York, that
Mecca of ambitious young Southerners, and
at the door of Beeker, Toomer &amp; Church,
esteemed by him and many another as the
great city’s leading architects. Mr. Church,
the junior partner, heard his application. A
little smile hovered about the man’s thin lips,
and a slight movement of the lines leading
southeast and southwest from the nostrils expressed
a cynical weariness.</p>

<p>“On an average,” said he with an air of
calculation, “we have applications from Cornell
men at the rate of six a week. And there
are others!” He waved a hand feebly toward
a vista of rooms with bending forms therein.
“We can’t always keep the crowd we have
busy.”</p>

<p>“I know all about that,” said King coolly,
“but perhaps you need a man in this special
line—art glass, stained glass windows?” He
opened a portfolio and laid some designs before
the architect.</p>

<p>Now, while no artist listens with patience
to business argument, none refuses to listen to
pictures. Mr. Church looked, carelessly at
first, then with a distinct show of interest. The
sheets slipped rapidly through his hands and
he shot a swift glance at his visitor.</p>

<p>“These yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Mr. Church pressed a button somewhere,
his eyes still on the designs. A little
gate opened.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he said.</p>

<p>And King Dubignon stood at the threshold
of his career.</p>

<p>Back in the junior partner’s office the designs
were more carefully examined.</p>

<p>“Very creditable,” was the grudging admission;
“it so happens that we may be able
to use a man in this line—temporarily. Be
seated.” He disappeared. When he returned
he was accompanied by a stout man of perhaps
forty-five, prompt of manner and with a
face that seemed to have been carved from
tinted marble after a Greek model. This one,
with quick eye, examined the designs, which
he handled as an expert handles Sevres.</p>

<p>“Excellent! Yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said King.</p>

<p>“Where are you from?”</p>

<p>“Georgia.”</p>

<p>“Learn this down there?”</p>

<p>“Partly, and partly at Cornell.”</p>

<p>“Nothing finer ever in this office, Church.
You want to work with us, I suppose?” This
to King.</p>

<p>“If agreeable, sir.”</p>

<p>“All right. How does twenty-five hundred
strike you for a starter?”</p>

<p>“Fine.” And then, “Just what I made last
year building freak cottages.” Mr. Beeker
laughed:</p>

<p>“I know; served my time on them. The
young wife brings you a home-made ground
plan, providing for hotel accommodations,
and wants a roof put over it—bay windows,
porte cochere, etc. Cries when she finds your
roof will cost more than her cottage. You’ll
be under Mr. Church, Mr.—”</p>

<p>“Dubignon.”</p>

<p>“Good old name. Any advice needed, drop
in on me.” He shook hands and turned away,
but came back and placed a finger on the
pictures:</p>

<p>“I say, Church, how about the memorial
windows?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think Mr. Dubignon might help.”</p>

<p>“Better give him a free hand on it.”</p>

<p>A sudden flush overspread the Southerner’s
face and his look of gratitude followed the
great architect.</p>

<p>But if King looked for sudden fame in New
York, he was disappointed. Putting aside his
ambition for the time being, he threw himself
into the task of developing along the special
line he had chosen for a foothold, with the
same ardor that had carried him to the front
at college, and his work stood all tests, easily.
Beeker, Toomer &amp; Church became headquarters
for art glass designs in architecture. Presently
his salary rose. And then again. And
at length he found himself independent. But,
to use his own expression, he “got nowhere.”
The reason was simple; it was a rule of the
office that all designs should bear the firm’s
name only. Church had carefully explained
this in the beginning. Church had also seen
to it that press notices of their notable work
invariably mentioned that Ralph Church was
the head of the department responsible for it.
King writhed under this system, but he could
not budge without financial backing. He was
heartily tired of his narrow field. At odd
times, in his own living room, he worked on
his ambitious dream.</p>

<p>The dream of the young architect was a
thirty-five story office building wherein utility
was to be combined with beauty without sacrifice
of dividend-paying space or money, and
without offense to the artistic eye from any
point of view. Many architects have wrestled
with the same problem and some with brilliant
results. Now, by strange coincidence,
a thirty-five story office building for Chicago,
financed in New York, began to be talked of
in building circles. No plans had been asked,
no consultation with architects had. A rumor
had started and was kicked around as a football.
King took the backward trail and patiently
followed it into the office of a certain
great banker, whose young woman secretary
had a friend that served an afternoon paper
in reportorial capacity. Here King met his
Waterloo; for no man in New York was less
accessible than this particular banker, who
had once received a “black-hand” letter. Red
tape, red-headed office boy, confidential clerks,
private secretary, hemmed him in from all but
his selected associates. And the banker’s
offices were full of unsuspected exits. All
roads led from his Rome.</p>

<p>King stalled at the red-headed boy—the
extreme outer guard.</p>

<p>It was at this stage of his career that he put
aside ambition and raced off to Georgia for
a few days along the coast. One proved sufficient.
He spent that laying holly wreaths on
graves under mossy live oaks. Then he betook
himself to Macon, to lunch and dine and sup
with his old-time S. A. E. friends of Mercer,
scene of his earliest college years. He found
them in law offices, doctor shops, banks and
trade—glad to see him, but busy. Then, bankrupt
of emotions, he began to stand on the
street corners during their busy hours and
watch the people pass.</p>

<p>And watching thus, he had seen <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>And, finally, after three days more in his
hotel, much boring of friends and many fruitless
chases of false rumors, and hours in front
of Wesleyan College, he had arrived at the
conclusion that he was, after all, a sublime
ass. Bearing this added burden, he had taken
himself off to New York, in what old-time
writers were pleased to call a frame of mind.</p>

<p>But, at the bottom of a formidable array
of Christmas greetings piled on his desk by
his devoted friend, Terence, the office boy, he
found an envelope postmarked “Jacksonville,
Fla., Dec. 25.” Within was a card, one of the
kind sold five for a nickel, bearing these lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I found your card in my bag on my way to
Florida. Am keeping it in memory of the only impudence
I have ever encountered at the hands of a man.
Nevertheless, I am wishing for you a very happy
Christmas and New Year. This, I take it, is the
proper Christmas spirit.</p>

<p class="right">“Beautiful.”</p>

<p>“P. S. Very likely I shall return to New York before
Easter.”</p>
</div>

<p>And for King Dubignon, Christmas came
back.</p>

<p>Also for Terence. The tip was five dollars,
and an injunction:</p>

<p>“Small boy, note this handwriting! You
will perceive that it is more of a jumping than
a running hand—well, it belongs on the top
of all mail. Understand?”</p>

<p>“I’m on,” said Terence with his broadest
grin.</p>

<p>“Return to New York,” quoted King, self
communing; “I should have known from the
way she crossed the street she belonged in
New York.”</p>

<p>“Sir?”</p>

<p>“On your way, Terence; on your way!” but
this with a smile.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter III</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LENT was well under way and the first
Easter displays in show windows
when on a Saturday morning, King
found a little note perched on the top of his
office mail, which read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If you will be at the old Delmonico corner near
Union Square Saturday at 4 P. M., you may walk
with me as far as Twenty-third Street, on condition
that you turn back there, and in the meantime ask
me no questions. Don’t come if the conditions don’t
suit.”</p>
</div>

<p>Whence she came, he never knew, but as
he stood waiting, she appeared before him,
her face radiant, her gentian eyes smiling up
to his. He lifted his hat quickly and fell into
step with her along the east side of Broadway.
Now that the supreme moment had arrived,
he raged inwardly that a species of
dumbness should have seized upon him. Turning
her head away, the girl laughed softly.
She had no fears. The subtle instinct of her
sex had informed her that it was not a contest
between man and girl, but between woman
and boy. The discovery pleased her. And
then, smiling, she challenged him:</p>

<p>“Well, sir, what have you to say for yourself?”</p>

<p>King rallied:</p>

<p>“This; you are to marry me, of course.
That was arranged in the beginning of all
things. The important thing now is to get
acquainted.” Again the low, sweet laugh and
upturned face:</p>

<p>“Sounds like the verdict of a fortune teller.
One of your old South Atlantic voodoos been
earning a dollar?” He was amazed. It was
not to be the last time this girl was to amaze
him. She was an amazing girl.</p>

<p>“Why place me at the South Atlantic?”</p>

<p>“Oh my! Innocent! Doesn’t everybody
know Charleston and Savannah brogue when
they hear it?”</p>

<p>“Close. But it was a little further down.
Are we so distinct, though?”</p>

<p>“Nobody can imitate it. I’ve tried. The
fraud was apparent. My poor voice sticks. I
can’t change it.”</p>

<p>“God forbid! But—getting back to the
wedding—I am in earnest.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t know even my name!”</p>

<p>“I have name enough for two.”</p>

<p>“Nor who I am.”</p>

<p>“I know who you will be. That’s enough.”</p>

<p>“Nor if I am—nice.”</p>

<p>“Don’t jest.”</p>

<p>“Nor my profession. I may be an artist’s
model, soubrette, chorus lady, paid companion,
waitress, manicurist, or lady’s maid.”
She glanced down at her very homely dress.</p>

<p>“I don’t care what your profession has
been. I can look into your face and see that
it has been honorable. It’s going to be Mrs.
King Dubignon. Look up! I love you, can’t
you see it?” Her eyes, swimming in light
and laughter, met his.</p>

<p>“You absurd boy! Do you always make
love this way? Is it the custom—‘a little
further down’ than Charleston and Savannah?”</p>

<p>“I have never before spoken of love to a
girl. My lips have never touched a girl’s.”
And then, “I have been waiting for you!”</p>

<p>A deep flush suffused her neck and face,
and for the first time she betrayed confusion.</p>

<p>“Don’t, please!” she whispered. “It is
impossible that any man could love any girl
so suddenly. And I don’t like to be treated as
a silly.” King had whirled suddenly and was
facing her.</p>

<p>“Impossible? Do you know that it takes
all the will power I can exert to keep from
snatching you up in my arms? I resist because
I don’t want to frighten you. What do I care
for people, for Broadway? This is the twentieth
century! We haven’t time to play guitars
under windows or sit in the moonlight week
after week testing our emotions. We live by
faith, move by faith—faith in ourselves, first,
because if we are square, that’s faith in God;
and then by faith in our women. And when
they are square, that’s trust in God. We don’t
just meet the women He creates for us; we
have known them all along. We just recognize
them and take their hands in ours for eternity.
My soul has been sitting at the window all my
life, waiting, watching. I have found you.
Name? family? occupation?—they are hung
on human beings as so many garments. I
don’t know any of yours, but I recognized you
at the first glance. You are for me and I for
you! And in your heart, you know it!”</p>

<p>“Come, oh, come!” she whispered hurriedly,
paling a little. “We must not stand
talking on the street. See, people are beginning
to stare. You are making me conspicuous.”
He followed her in silence disdaining
to look about him, but already regretting his
outburst. It had gathered more force and
emphasis than he intended. His moodiness
returned. Where were all the fine things he
had planned to say? What a thistle eater he
was!</p>

<p>They had reached Madison Square. She
regained composure first and seated herself
on a convenient bench. He heard again the
sweet, low laughter and felt her eyes looking
up to him.</p>

<p>“Funny, isn’t it?” he questioned ruefully.</p>

<p>“Immense!” Very prompt.</p>

<p>“You believe me, nevertheless.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I believe <i>you</i> do. But come, sit down
and tell me about that home, a little further
down than Charleston and Savannah.
Coast?”</p>

<p>“Island,” he said, rather glad of the
change.</p>

<p>“Surf, and all that, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Nothing finer on the ocean. Coney Island,
Rockaway, Cape May, Atlantic City—why,
the surf there is a ripple compared with Cumberland
and Tybee.”</p>

<p>“You swim, of course.”</p>

<p>“All islanders swim, like river rats. You
should see the breakers at Cumberland—twenty
miles of them down to Dungeness. It
takes a swimmer to get through there, and
back, when the wind is in the northeast. But
it’s second nature with the natives. They ride
the combers like wild horses.”</p>

<p>“How long have you ever been in the
water—there, among the—wild horses?”
She leaned forward eagerly, her eyes searching
his every feature.</p>

<p>“Ten hours, once. You see I was pretty
small and the tide took me out. But it couldn’t
drown me. And a lumber boat happened
along.”</p>

<p>“But if the boat hadn’t happened along?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the tide would have brought me back.
Dead, maybe, but I think not. I am a floater.
Some swimmers are not balanced right for
floating. Women hardly ever.” She gave him
a friendly smile.</p>

<p>“And there is where your home is?”</p>

<p>“What the war left of it—two wings of a
cochina house and an unbroken view of desolation.
But it was home.”</p>

<p>“Now you are talking sensibly. Home!
That’s always worth talking about. Let’s
quit the foolish love business.”</p>

<p>“And yet, it is love that makes the home.”</p>

<p>“True. But think of a home where the
wife was won, a stranger, by a stranger, on
the street.”</p>

<p>“That is strongly put. I had not thought
of it that way.”</p>

<p>“Better now than too late.”</p>

<p>“The answer is, in my case, that you are
not a stranger. Outside of every man’s life
there is a woman standing—just outside, her
radiance across his path. He is always conscious
of her there, but he cannot see her. He
finds himself striving because of her; ambitious,
because of her. Then one day she steps
in and he recognizes her. And because of her
he keeps his soul clean and face to the sunrise.
Some call her the Ideal. But I know her as
the woman God made for me. Now you understand
what I meant when I said I had
waited for you all my life.”</p>

<p>“What a beautiful thought!”</p>

<p>“It’s not my fault I met you on the street.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it may not always be, on the
street.”</p>

<p>“You mean you will let me come to see you
some day?”</p>

<p>“I am not suggesting that.”</p>

<p>“Then, you never will?”</p>

<p>“I have not said so.” He relapsed into
moody silence.</p>

<p>“Listen,” she said, at length, picking up
the loose end. “You are not altogether a
stranger either.” Again that swift, half mocking,
upward smile. “Outside of every girl’s
life there is a man standing—just outside, his
shadow across her path. She is always conscious
of him there; she knows him as the
man God made for her, but she cannot see
him. Then, one day, he steps in and she recognizes
him.”</p>

<p>“What a beautiful thought!” he echoed.
And then: “Down in Macon, for instance,
did you recognize me?”</p>

<p>“I am inclined to think I did,” she answered
with a faint smile. “Nevertheless,
I took you at your word, and asked about
you.”</p>

<p>“In Macon?”</p>

<p>“No, silly.”</p>

<p>“What did you learn?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are a talented young draughtsman,
and ambitious. Also, you are a dreamer,
an impetuous dreamer. You certainly are
that. If I were an adventuress as well as—penniless,
I might marry you and take chances
on your success. I could always quit, you
know. But I am not an adventuress and marriage
is impossible for us.”</p>

<p>“Why impossible?” The sun was gone.</p>

<p>“There is a fact—I can’t tell you now. And
you were to ask me no questions. But the
fact is, now, insurmountable.”</p>

<p>“Tell me that fact.”</p>

<p>“I cannot. But, on my honor, if I did you
would not want to marry me. You would
leave me on the street and never return.”
Her face, now grave and earnest, was lifted
fearlessly and her eyes met his in sincerity.
His dumb distress touched her. Her color
deepened a little—the passing of a thought.
The light of battle flashed in his brown eyes.</p>

<p>“Here is the limit you set—Madison
Square. Here is my answer: The only fact
I recognize is, you have stepped into my life;
you are my woman. Beautiful, come with
me to the City Hall for a license, and then to
the minister. Yonder is a taxi. I love you—I’d
just as lieve marry you out of the street as
out of a palace!” He drew a thin circlet of
gold from his finger. “Here is my mother’s
wedding ring, almost her sole legacy to me.
It goes with my faith that you are the kind
of woman she was!” Mist was in the eyes,
turned suddenly away, and then back to him.
Her face glowed with an almost unearthly
light and beauty. She reached out, took the
ring, kissed it and handed it back.</p>

<p>“With reverence,” she said tenderly, “but
I cannot wear it. There is a reason why I can
not. It’s not for me now. You’ll know some
day.” Mystified, he stood silently watching
her face. And then:</p>

<p>“You’ll see me again soon, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But I am not always free. I
shall have to pick a time. Now, you go back,
please. I must go on. But wait—I—I want
to thank you for that faith. It is the most
beautiful thing I have ever known. It would
not be hard to learn to love such a—boy.”</p>

<p>She smiled divinely. “Goodbye!”</p>

<p>One of them looked back, after the parting.
The psychologists know which.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter IV</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOUR days of suffering registered on
the Southerner. In the hours when he
should have been sleeping, he picked
at the meshes that held him. It was true that
he seemed to have always been conscious of
this girl whose vivid beauty now enslaved
him. (These artists have wider worlds than
the common run of humans.) But what fact
had she in mind which, if revealed, would
make his love impossible? Who and what
was she? He gathered the threads of evidence:
her time was not her own; she was,
by her own admission, or so he construed it,
penniless; he had met her when offices were
discharging stenographers for the day, and
shop girls were beginning to start homeward;
when she left him, she went in the direction
of the theater district. But why shouldn’t
he marry a stenographer, or an actress, or a
shop girl? Or even a model or manicurist or
a lady’s maid, if she were square? What had
her occupation to do with his happiness?</p>

<p>King was younger than his years, as are
most Southerners, but he was sensitive to delicate
influences. Without analysis, he knew
that this girl had touched an atmosphere of
refinement and was educated. And she had
traveled. But what was so poor a girl doing
in Charleston and Savannah and Macon? It
sounded like a theatrical route. One day, on
impulse, he consulted a theatrical agency and
learned that “Naughty Marietta” had been
in Macon on the 23d of December and Jacksonville
on the 24th. He knew the opera and
had seen its array of beauties and yet he could
not figure out why, being of the Marietta
company should keep her from marrying him.
But—and there came the devil’s hand in his
affairs—but these theater girls marry so recklessly!
King sat up in bed when this thought
arrived and uttered a word he had learned
from his grandfather’s overseer. It was not
a nice word. And yet—and here a gentler
voice intervened—and yet, don’t you know
the girl isn’t married? Don’t you know?</p>

<p>Of course he knew, the girl was not married!</p>

<p>Then what the thunder was all the row
about? Father in the penitentiary? Mother
scrubbing office buildings for a living?
Brother a pickpocket? Sister gone to the
bad? Tuberculosis? Pellagra? Not these
latter, certainly.</p>

<p>And what had the others to do with her
marrying him? Nothing, if he had a say so.</p>

<p>He dismissed them with a mental finger-snap,
and put his faith again in destiny. She
was his woman. He would win her in spite
of herself.</p>

<p>Then on the fifth day came a little note.
He was to be at the entrance to the Metropolitan
Museum at one hour past high noon.
He was there promptly. She descended from
a bus at the corner and came to him rapidly.</p>

<p>“Inside,” she said, smiling but passing. He
followed. Inside she fell back with him. Then
came the quick, characteristic upward look.
The gentian eyes were troubled.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing to yourself,
little boy? Are you working too hard?”</p>

<p>“Scarcely that,” he laughed, “but possibly
sleeping less than usual. And you?—but why
ask! You are the same radiant, beautiful girl
as when I first saw you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t, please. I detest flattery.”</p>

<p>“The word ‘beautiful’ doesn’t flatter you.
But I think I understand. However, if I’m
not to call you that, what am I to do for a
name? Can’t you trust me with some little
old name?”</p>

<p>“My uncle calls me Billee, when he finds
me amiable; Bill, when he is displeased, and
William, when he is out of all patience. You
can take them all three. You’ll need them
later.”</p>

<p>“Miss Billee will do for me.”</p>

<p>“Billee, or nothing, sir!”</p>

<p>“All right. Now then, Billee, listen to me.
You’ve been through this place?”</p>

<p>“Dozens of times. I suggested it because
at this hour it is not frequented by—because
it is apt to be uncrowded, and I wanted to be
alone with you. Forgive me if I shock you.”</p>

<p>“Forgive you! Come, I know a place
where few people will be passing. It is both
public and private.”</p>

<p>“All right. Let’s go sit down and tell glad
stories of live kings.”</p>

<p>“Good paraphrase. Where did you learn
the original?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I read to an old lady friend a great
deal. I’m learning lots of pretty things in
books.” Lightly touching her arm, he guided
her to a broad seat screened by a marble
group at the far end of the hall.</p>

<p>“Here is the place! Now I have a confession
to make. I have not been strictly true
to you—to myself.”</p>

<p>“Been flirting elsewhere?”</p>

<p>“The truth is I inquired of a theatrical
agency what company was in Macon on December
23d, the day I met you, and was informed
it was ‘Naughty Marietta.’ That is
all. Don’t think I am asking you a question.
It makes no difference to me if you are
Marietta herself or a chorus girl.” Billee
gasped and after a swift glance to his solemn
face laughed until her eyes swam in tears.</p>

<p>“You dear boy! No, I am not an actress,
that is, professionally. I went to Jacksonville,
since you want to know, as—can you
stand a shock?”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me. I don’t care to know.”
She picked at a darned place in her glove.</p>

<p>“As the companion of an old lady. Are you
very much disappointed?”</p>

<p>“Happy old lady!” said King fervently.
“Disappointed? I have an intense admiration
for the girl who earns her own living. But,
Billee, why work?”</p>

<p>“Don’t! You have forgotten the fatal
fact.”</p>

<p>“But there is no fact that can be fatal to us,
unless—unless, you are already married!”
She considered this a moment, her face very
grave.</p>

<p>“And you think it possible that I might be
married and at the same time willing to meet
you this way? How could you love such a
person?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said King miserably, in
over his head, “but there are only two things
could keep you from me—death and marriage.
And believe me, Billee, you are far
from dead.” Then suddenly the little hand
was slipped in his and he saw his own image
in the gentian eyes.</p>

<p>“King—you will let me call you that, won’t
you?—my King! Oh, don’t you understand?
There must be a mystery between us; how
long, the good God only knows—but it may
not keep us from each other all the time.
Can’t we be just sweethearts till then? Don’t
you know I love to be with you—and—and
would love you—if I might? Don’t you
know? Don’t you know, King?” The inevitable
happened. She was swept up in the arms
of the young man and his lips were pressed to
hers. For one long moment, while the world
swam about her and her heart stood still, she
lay unresisting, helpless. Then he released
her and leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>“My God!” he cried in a whisper, staring
at her, incredulous. “Can you ever forgive
me? I was crazy, mad—I did not know what
I was doing! Billee, go! Leave me and never
come back! I deserve it!” He was trembling
from head to foot. She arose with slow dignity,
her face very pale, and tidied her slightly
disarranged dress, her eyes timidly searching
the perspective ahead, and lips quivering.
There was but one couple in view and their
backs were turned.</p>

<p>“King,” she said, “you must promise me
you’ll never do that again; you must, King,
or I shall have to leave you and not return.”</p>

<p>“I swear it! Never until you lay your head
on my breast, of your own free will!” But
presently she turned and faced him bravely,
her eyes again on his. A new note was in her
voice. She seemed older.</p>

<p>“King, I can’t bear to see you look unhappy;
and I am not a hypocrite. I forgive
you, because—I am glad you kissed me, just
once—and in that way. Now, I do not
doubt—”</p>

<p>“You cannot doubt—”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt <i>myself</i>! King, my splendid
boy—oh, this is shameful!” She choked,
covered her eyes with one hand, stretched the
other blindly toward him, but before he could
take it, was gone. He stood as she left him,
looking down the vista through which she
fled, but seeing nothing. Presently he pressed
the back of one hand to his eyes and then examined
it in wonder.</p>

<p>“Oh Terence! Terence! what would you
give to see that! You’d blackmail me fifty
years.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter V</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next note reached King four days
after his meeting with Billee in the
Museum. The four days had seemed
four years. It would be untrue to say that the
mystery of it all did not continue to wear on
him in the hours when he should have been
sleeping, but the Southerner is born and dies
an optimist, and is usually loyal to his ideals.
King’s loyalty refused to entertain a doubt.
Who could doubt Billee’s eyes? The note
came as his reward, or so he cheered himself.
It appointed a meeting for the afternoon
in one of New York’s suburban churches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The choir will be rehearsing for Easter, but the
church doors will be open and only a few, if any,
people in the pews. Go at four and find a seat well
back, over on the left. I shall join you as soon as I
am free to come. Dear King, I have been so miserable,
so happy! Please, please, don’t make love to
me any more. But don’t stop loving me. Please
understand. I am not in a position for your love—now.
Trust me—whatever happens don’t doubt that
I love you. There now! I have said it. Does it make
you happy? It makes me miserable, but I am only
happy now when I’m miserable about you.</p>

<p class="right">“Billee.”</p>
</div>

<p>The world stood still for King Dubignon,
or at least time seemed to, when the hurried,
unrevised, illogical little note revealed its
message. Trust her? Trust Billee? Well,
rather! He stowed it in his deepest pocket
along with some other priceless compositions
of hers, and went off to church much ahead of
the appointed time. The <i>chiaroscuro</i> over on
the left received him, and ages after, she
glided into the pew and slipped her hand in
his, while the choir sang, afar off, “Lead,
kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom.”</p>

<p>Speech, while the divine voices carried that
wonderful song-prayer, would have been sacrilege.
And, though he did not analyze, it was
expressing his feelings far better than he
knew how.</p>

<p>He covered the one hand he held with his
other and sat in silent bliss, and presently she
added the one, little, lonesome hand she had
left to the friendly group, and nestled up
closer.</p>

<p>“Just sweethearts!” she whispered.</p>

<p>When the hymn was ended, he was dreaming
off toward a beautiful window of stained
glass. The colors were exquisitely blended,
the design simple. In the foreground was a
cross and scroll bearing a name. In the deep
perspective, the sun was setting, its splendor
on a single drifting cloud. To the right and
left of the cross cherubs hovered, one face
lifted, the other foreshortened, and eyes
closed. The faces were identical.</p>

<p>A loved one slept under the cross; a spirit
had ascended to heaven. This was the story
they told.</p>

<p>“You like my window? I call it mine because
I love it so. And I am afraid I come
oftener to see it than to pray.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said King, gently, “I like it.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen it before?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Tell me what about it impresses you
most.”</p>

<p>“The two little faces.”</p>

<p>“Oh! and I love them most, too. Perhaps
you have never heard the romance, the miracle
of that window.”</p>

<p>“Romance? Miracle?”</p>

<p>“It is a memorial to Agnes Vandilever,
erected by her husband.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But the romance?”</p>

<p>“The artist who designed it, though he had
never seen or heard of her child, accidentally
made the two faces portraits of that child. If
she had posed for him, they could not have
been nearer perfect. That’s why her father
selected the design over the dozens submitted.”</p>

<p>“That I had heard.”</p>

<p>“But the romance is this: the little girl is
now grown, and one of the richest girls in the
world—are you listening?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said King, whose gaze had returned
to the two little faces. “You were saying she
is rich—one of the world’s richest girls. I
know that. A century though lies between her
and the little ones yonder. She can never
dream back to them. I was thinking of that.”</p>

<p>“Wait! No man ever knows all that’s in
a girl’s heart. Early in life when she was just
a little child as pictured yonder, she was the
victim of a ferry boat collision off Cortlandt
Street. My old lady friend—the one I live
with—is her relative. I have seen Miss Vandilever
many times, and have often read her
story in some old newspapers. She was but
eight years old when the accident occurred,
and in the care of an old negro nurse on the
boat. The family were on their way up from
the South, and the little girl and her nurse had
gone out of the cabin to the deck to see the
lights. When the collision occurred, both
were thrown into the river. In the confusion
of the moment and noise of whistles and the
screams, the minor accident was not noticed
nor were the cries of the woman and child
heard except by one person, a boy of sixteen
or seventeen, who was also out to see the
lights, and probably New York for the first
time. This boy plunged into the river from
the sinking boat and succeeded in reaching
the little girl. Then—how, only the good God
who was watching, knows—he got out of his
coat and kicked off his shoes and would probably
have swum to the wharves with her, but
a tug, at full speed and blowing its whistle for
other boats to come, ran over them. Shall I
wait for the organ to stop?”</p>

<p>“No, your voice and that music were made
for just such a story. The tug ran over
them—”</p>

<p>“As it struck, the boy seized the dress of
the child at the throat, with his teeth, covered
her face with his hands, and went down with
her. The boat passed, and they rose and
whirled in the foam of its wake. The boy’s
teeth held like a bulldog’s, though the barnacles
on the tug had torn his side cruelly and
something had broken his left arm. He could
now only support the child by swimming on
his back, her face drawn up to his breast, her
hands clinging to his shoulders, and body
floating free.”</p>

<p>“He knew how to save a drowning person,
who wasn’t panic-stricken. It must have been
a brave child to keep her head through it all.”</p>

<p>“As they drifted on with the tide, unseen,
he comforted her, promising he would be
sure to get her to the land and take her home.
He stopped calling for help when he found
his voice frightened her. And then he laughed
to show her he was not afraid, and told her
little stories of the South, where he came
from, and sang the songs his black mammy
sang to him when he was very little, so that
the girl forgot her fears and put her faith in
the wonderful boy, who knew so much, and
had come to help her.</p>

<p>“Then, after a long while, he told her to
try and sleep; to lay her head on his breast,
but first to lift her face up toward the skies
and pray God for her father and mother and
the old black woman, who had ‘turned back
because she couldn’t swim,’ and to bring the
boy and herself to the land soon. And she did.
And then, maybe, she went to sleep, for she
could never afterwards remember any more.
And maybe the boy went to sleep, too, for
they found them both floating under the stars
off the Liberty Light hours later, his one good
arm slowly, oh! so slowly, striking the water,
the other, broken and trailing under him, and
his white face turned upward, and his teeth
again clenched on the child’s dress, so hard
they had to cut it to get her away from him.”
Billee suddenly drew her hands away and covered
her face.</p>

<p>“He was probably tired and asleep, too,”
said King gently, “you can’t drown that kind
of chap.”</p>

<p>“It’s the song ‘Absent’ that voice is singing
up there,” said Billee, furtively wiping her
eyes. “It always did get the best of me.
Listen.”</p>

<div class="verse">Thinking I see thee smile.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“You were telling me of the boy and girl,”
he reminded, gently, as she sat dreaming.</p>

<p>“Yes. Her father and mother, who had
been saved, began a frantic search for her.
She was their only child. They offered fortunes
to any one who would find her, dead or
alive, and the river and bay were full of tugs
and patrol boats, and fire boats and launches
hurrying here and there under the searchlights.
When they found the poor, old, dead
nurse, with a little hair ribbon clenched in her
hand, all hope fled. But a barge captain
landed the boy and girl at the Battery. In a
few minutes the city knew that the little heiress
to many millions was safe in her mother’s
arms. And great surgeons were working over
the boy in St. Luke’s. You must read it yourself
some day. I lose so much in telling it.”</p>

<p>“Go on. I’d rather hear you.”</p>

<p>“But there isn’t much more to tell. The boy
refused to give his name. He seemed afraid
somebody would hang a medal on him and
make a speech, and that the papers would
write him up and print his picture, and he’d
never get over it. Said it was nothing, at last.
That he could swim from Georgia to New
York if the water stayed smooth and somebody
was along to cook for him.</p>

<p>“But the girl and her mother came every
day and brought him flowers and good things
to eat, and in the imagination of that little
child he grew to be the greatest hero in the
world. And he must have liked her, for he
would hold her hand and tell her the stories
over and over: Br’er Rabbit and Br’er Fox
and the Tar-Baby. The old lady I live with
has one of his little songs written out. It’s
‘Little Boy Blue’—added to; Little Boy Blue
and his master who found him asleep:</p>

<div class="verse">Master, the day was long and lonely,</div>

</div></div>

<p>“The boy in the hospital liked it because he
had no mother, either, except to dream of.</p>

<p>“It was too beautiful to last. When he was
almost well and his arm was out of the sling,
the little girl’s father came to talk business
with him. Splendid plans for that boy her
father had, but they failed abruptly. He refused
to consider them, even. He refused
everything except the cost of his coat and
shoes, and the amount of money that was in
the coat. He was an orphan and on his way
to school, he said, and was obliged to have
that much. He was gentle and quiet about it
all, and finally the girl’s father said: ‘You
are an American, all right! I like your independence.
Good for you!’ And to the day of
his death, he loved and admired and talked
about that boy. But he never saw him again.”</p>

<p>“He must have been worth knowing—that
father. Did they ever learn the boy’s name?”</p>

<p>“No. The little girl’s father would not let
anybody try. Said he was probably the descendant
of some proud old cotton king down
South and would turn up some day, either very
bad or very good—they always did. A reporter
had taken a snapshot of him as he sat
on the hospital cot, but her father took his
camera from him by force and gave him fifty
dollars in place of it. The little girl has the
picture yet.”</p>

<p>“But if they had published the picture?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you didn’t know her father. He said
it would be a violation of honor as between
gentlemen. No, he had begun life a friendless
boy himself, and he understood.”</p>

<p>“A beautifully told story. Tell me of the
little girl who was saved.”</p>

<p>“There is the romance. The boy promised
to come back when he became famous—”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“But he has probably forgotten her, in his
own struggles. She was nothing to him, after
all; only a little girl child he had pulled out
of the water. But she—well, as the years
passed, he grew to be almost a god, in her
memory. You see there were the old papers
to read over, and the little picture, and the
song he had given her. And there was the
telling of it all, over and over, at school. Her
romance became a living thing, an immortal
thing.”</p>

<p>“I know. A thought conceived <i>is</i> a living
thing. Expressed, it is immortal.”</p>

<p>“Then her mother died, and they built that
beautiful window in memory of her, and then
her father. Now, she is her own mistress,
though an uncle imagines he is, in fact, as well
as in law, her guardian. She comes nearer
being his. They call her ‘a terror’ at home.
Still, men have wanted to marry her, many of
them, but she is unchanging in her faith that
some day her hero will come back and claim
her. What do you suppose her father said to
her—his very last words?—‘wait for him
until you are twenty-one. It takes a long time
for a boy to become famous. I think I know
him. He will come if he makes good, and
when he does come, remember it’s fifty-fifty.’
She had never told her father of her dream,
but he had guessed, and he smiled when he
saw he had guessed right, and died with the
smile on his face. So she waits, and waits,
and waits, at times most unhappy. Do you
suppose he will come back, King?”</p>

<p>“How could he? How could such a boy
come to claim so rich a girl?” he answered
earnestly. “It seems to me she would know
that the boy was father to the man. Her
wealth will always be between them. Besides
he may have proved a dismal failure.”</p>

<p>“What! He?” Billee looked up indignant.
“Why, he just couldn’t fail!”</p>

<p>“Do you really think he is bound to come
back to her—when he succeeds.”</p>

<p>“Certainly! Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I do not! Has she ever seen him again?”</p>

<p>“She thinks she has—once. But he did not
know it. She is afraid if she sought him, she
would lose him.”</p>

<p>“She understands him, after all, then.”</p>

<p>“But she doesn’t want just <i>him</i>. She wants
him to make good. Wants him the same independent
boy she remembers. She knows, too,
that only in stories do New York heiresses
marry poor, unknown young men. Money
isn’t everything with them, though. There is
something better, but they don’t all find it. A
good name means a great name in New York
and a great name is better than riches with
the rich city girl who is free to choose her
husband.”</p>

<p>“What a girl! What a tragedy should he
have learned to love another!”</p>

<p>“But he can’t, King! He may not know
it, but he can’t escape a love like that. It will
pull him from the end of the world. <i>She is
just outside his life and her radiance is across
his path. Some day she will just step in and he
will recognize her.</i> <i>You</i> believe in that. <i>You</i>
said so. Love isn’t just an emotion; it’s a
power. Even God wouldn’t try to tear it to
pieces. He made it and—well, I guess He
knows there wouldn’t be any immortality
without it.”</p>

<p>King patted Billee’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Loyal to your ideals, aren’t you? Good!
When our ideals perish, the kernel’s out of
the shell, the juice out of the grape!</p>

<p>“And such, then, is the story of the little
girl whose face is in the window.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but wasn’t it a miracle that Mr.
Church, a very ordinary man, I am told,
should have dreamed just such a dream, and
have guessed those little faces into it?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Church did not dream it,” said King
very gently. The girl’s wondering eyes turned
slowly toward him.</p>

<p>“What! <i>Who</i>, then?”</p>

<p>“The design was furnished by Beeker,
Toomer &amp; Church, but it was not Church’s
work.”</p>

<p>“Whose, then?” And as he hesitated, she
repeated the question earnestly, “Whose?”
and waited breathlessly. King hesitated and
stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>“Mine,” he said, at length. Billee sat in
strained silence. The information was for
the moment beyond her comprehension. Her
voice was a whisper when she spoke:</p>

<p>“You mean—it is <i>your</i> work—you designed
that window?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am a draughtsman with Beeker,
Toomer &amp; Church, as you know. Did I never
mention that art glass designs is my specialty
there? Yes, it is my work. The little faces
are half memory, half dream. One prays,
one sleeps.”</p>

<p>“Yours! Yours!” Her hand tightened
in the hand that again clasped it, and shook.
“You—you—furnished the memorial for my—my
little girl’s mother!—for Agnes Vandilever!
Then <i>you were</i> the boy—the little
girl loved! You’ve been carrying the face
that was lifted above you that night—the face
that slept on your breast—in your heart,
all these years? Oh, King! King! it’s true!
it’s true!—isn’t it?” She was trembling. Her
hands tightened on his and her eyes were beseeching
him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, at length. “I was
that boy. The little faces have been with me
all these years. I rather think they may have
kept me out of bad company sometimes, and
from loneliness.” A sob shook Billee and
suddenly she slipped forward to her knees and
buried her face in her arms on the pew rail.
Presently King reached out and laid his hand
on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t change anything Billee. There’s
but one girl in the world for me—one grown-up
girl. I am sorry for Miss Vandilever’s
romance, but some day she will meet and
marry a real man. They always do—these
story girls. My little dream girls wouldn’t
know her now, nor she them. It is you, who
are the older vision of them, not the painted
society belle.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, King,” she sobbed, “that is
good of you.” And then, with a wistful little
smile, “Oh, King, you must succeed! <i>Do
something great!</i> Don’t let another man
steal your talents, your fame—and your
sweetheart!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter VI</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the months that followed the meeting
in the church, King saw Billee frequently.
She came to him at places below Twenty-third
Street usually, and he could not help but
notice that she was at times a little nervous.
She developed a fancy for downtown picture
shows, and he began to be concerned for her.
Her dress was not always what it should have
been, her gloves alternated between holes and
darns. Once, admitting that she was hungry,
she had let him take her into one of the white
restaurants scattered throughout the city and
served by girls. She enjoyed it all unaffectedly,
the only drawback being that her beauty
made her conspicuous. Their presence in the
lunch-house raised a little storm of excitement
among the girls, which King noticed with uneasiness.
He arrived at the conclusion, unwillingly,
that he was dressed too well for the
girl he was escorting.</p>

<p>And once, face to face with her, a gentleman
paused and half raised his hat. He
blocked the way. Billee’s little chin went into
the air ignoring him, but King roughly shoved
the fellow into the gutter.</p>

<p>“Shall I go back and beat him up?” he
asked, overtaking Billee, who was hurrying
away.</p>

<p>“No,” she said a little hysterically, and
laughing, “come, he probably took me for
someone else.” But King thought otherwise.</p>

<p>One evening they wandered from a picture
play and found a seat in Washington Square.</p>

<p>“See here, Billee,” he said, “I don’t know
what your secret is, but we have about reached
the limit in some things. I am going to be
blunt, even rude, you will think; but last week
you borrowed a carfare of me and your
gloves are frightful. And your dress!—come,
it’s all wrong. You won’t marry me,
won’t talk about it even; let’s switch off and
you be just a trusting little friend in all things
until your affairs straighten out. You need
things. The fact keeps me unhappy. I have
plenty of money; let me be banker and provide
everything. And if your job isn’t pleasant
or profitable, drop it. There is no need
for you to do menial work or be at the beck
and call of exacting old ladies. I can take
care of you until you find a congenial occupation.”</p>

<p>But her face was something more than a
study when he looked into it after the offer,
which had embarrassed him not a little. Her
mouth trembled and her eyes turned from
him.</p>

<p>“You mean—you want to—want me to
take a flat somewhere and—let you—pay the
rent?”</p>

<p>“Good God, no!” She watched him as
though fascinated by a vision.</p>

<p>“King, it would be wonderful—just to see
you coming and going every day!”</p>

<p>“Billee!” She laughed and suddenly hid
her face.</p>

<p>“What a boy it is, still!” She looked up
shyly. “No, King, when you are your own
man and successful and other men speak your
name with admiration and you are so secure
in your field you can marry whom you please,
even a girl who has done menial work—if you
want me then, I will come to you, and the
flat, if you want a flat. Till then, it’s—just
sweethearts.”</p>

<p>“Wait, then, until my office building is up,”
he said, trying to disguise by affected gayety
how he was touched. “Art glass was only my
struggle for a foothold. I am by education
an architect.”</p>

<p>“<i>Your</i> office building! Who is it for?”</p>

<p>“John Throckmorton. But he doesn’t
know it yet.”</p>

<p>“John Throckmorton, the banker?” Billee
gurgled and gasped. Then she suppressed a
little scream and stared wildly.</p>

<p>“Yes, the plans are all ready.”</p>

<p>“Has he seen them?”</p>

<p>“No; there’s the hitch. He has only talked
about a thirty-five story building out in Chicago,
a trust fund investment. So far it has
been impossible to break through the guard
around him. Harvard couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>She was silent a long moment, with parted
lips, still staring at him.</p>

<p>“Listen, King. Do you believe in premonitions?”</p>

<p>“Hunches? Yes. Terence, my office boy,
has one every time there is a big game on up
at the park, and he needs somebody to finance
him. They never fail.”</p>

<p>“I have one now. Try again—for my sake,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>“For your sake, I’ll camp on Throckmorton’s
trail like a poor relation. What time
has your premonition selected?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow at twelve o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Sounds more like lunch than hunch.”</p>

<p>“Send your card in at twelve. Will you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll gamble on you once, Billee. At twelve
my card goes in—for your sake. At twelve
one I come out, for my own,” he laughed.</p>

<p>“You promise? King, I am really very
superstitious.”</p>

<p>“So am I—about you.”</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock next day King handed his
card to the red-headed outer guard at Banker
Throckmorton’s office. To his everlasting
astonishment, the boy smiled genially.</p>

<p>“Come in, Mr. Dubignon,” he said. And
by the inner guard and the extreme inner
guard and the secretary entanglements, King
marched straight into the august Presence.
All roads led to Rome. Ten minutes later he
came out, his head in the clouds. His cherished
plans for a thirty-five story office building
were behind him. Billee’s eyes danced
when he told her the story.</p>

<p>But he went no more. The banker had
promised to send for him when he got a report
on the plans from older architects. He
did not send, and Billee was away in Boston
with that restless old woman. What the devil
did she want to be prancing around the country
for at her age? Meaning the old woman,
of course.</p>

<p>Hope began to shrivel. The office building
grew smaller. It lost a story a day for thirty-five
days. Nothing but the cellar, a hole in
the ground, was left. He laid himself down
in that and pulled the hole in.</p>

<p>And the green grass grew all around.</p>

<p>Then Billee came back with a rush, and
things began to move. Fate had completed
her gambit. She pushed a queen. The queen
was Billee, of course.</p>

<p>A wonderful day was at hand, for King.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter VII</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE wonderful day, the day for memory,
was that on which King took
Billee to Coney Island. June had arrived
with white dresses, canvas shoes, Palm
Beach suits, straw hats and sea yearnings.
Billee had telephoned him from somewhere
to meet her at Bowling Green at eleven. They
would take cars to the Island and come back
by boat at ten to Battery Park. Her old lady
was off to New England again with the
Plymouth Rockers, celebrating an anniversary,
and would not return until next day.
Her friend, the housemaid, would sit up for
her, and the subway wasn’t far. And be sure
and meet her or she would die of disappointment;
she had never been to Coney Island.</p>

<p>She was wearing something white and simple,
and came with a wonder light in her eyes,
swinging a little bag gayly up to his face.</p>

<p>“Guess,” she cried, “my one extravagance!”</p>

<p>“Sandwich,” he ventured. Billee screamed:</p>

<p>“Bathing suit, silly!”</p>

<p>“Great heavens! And you can pack it in
that?”</p>

<p>“Ought I to have brought a trunk?”</p>

<p>“A trunk? I hate to say it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t.”</p>

<p>Now to King Dubignon was revealed a
new Billee. She was the spirit of light and
laughter, and the faces of all who saw her
that day shone with sympathy and admiration.
She was a child out of school, and seeing
the world for the first time.</p>

<p>“Poor little girl,” he said within, an ache
deep down, “she hasn’t had much fun. Never
mind, it’s coming some day.” It was coming
that day. It had in fact already arrived.</p>

<p>“King,” breathlessly, after a daring pressure
of his hand, “bear with me to-day. I’m
simply wild, <i>wild!</i> and not responsible. I’ve
heard good news, great news, and it’s killing
me with happiness. It’s my great day, you
big, handsome, loving boy!—my boy!”</p>

<p>“Keep going, Billee, I’ll never stop you.
Am I in on it?”</p>

<p>“Are you? <i>Are</i> you? How could it be good
news if you were not?”</p>

<p>He was certain he had never seen anything
half as funny as Billee that day, sliding down
the “corkscrew,” unless it was Billee trying
to navigate the whirling bowl and crawling
out on hands and knees, her little jaws set
hard and eyes imploring him. For they took
in all the features of the Island, did all the
undignified stunts, rode the wooden race
horses, and flying-jennies, shot the chutes,
journeyed through Wonderland, circled the
Ferris wheel, shot at targets, threw rings for
dolls and balls at grinning “coon” heads, saw
the fat woman and alligator boy and the
Hawaiian dancers.</p>

<p>The offer of a free trip up and five dollars
by the captive balloon man, if they would
marry in the air, was promptly accepted by
King but spurned by Billee.</p>

<p>Then they ran races on the beach with other
carefree couples, built sand houses with little
children, ate popcorn, “hot dog” and cotton
candy and saw the movies. And Billee drank
a pony of beer and lit a cigarette for King.</p>

<p>Once they came across a wild, ragtime
dance scene, and Billee screamed with delight.
It seemed to be everybody’s frolic.</p>

<p>“Come on, King, I must dance with you!”</p>

<p>“But,” sadly, “it’s the one accomplishment
I lack, Billee. All the others I have. My
young life was not cast in ragtime circles.”</p>

<p>“Come, sir, come! I’ll teach you!” He
went. She said it was easy. It was not easy.
“It’s easy” is a fiction of the game. She did
not teach him, but among the dancers was a
young man, coat buttoned tight across his
waist and lapels spread wide and a little felt
hat slouched across his northeast temple, who
handled himself and partner like a pair of
Indian clubs. It was a pleasure to watch him
and the little “skirt” he toyed with. His eyes
met Billee’s. He left his partner in the middle
of the floor, as a matter of course.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Bo’?” he said to King.
“Can’t little Beauty dance?” King regarded
the visitor with amusement. He was too cosmopolitan
to take offense. This was New
York’s playground.</p>

<p>“Ask her,” he said, ironically.</p>

<p>“Dance, kid?” said the boy cryptically, to
Billee.</p>

<p>“Sure!” said Billee, giving her hand. And
Billee danced. It was the most wonderful
thing, of the kind, King had ever seen. The
band was playing “Don’t Blame Me for What
Happens in the Moonlight,” and the two
figures, threading a marvelous path through
the crowd, swayed, dipped, hesitated, glided
and whirled in perfect rhythm. Billee’s face
glowed with excitement, her gentian eyes half
closed harbored all the fun in the world.
Passing King, she called:</p>

<p>“Going some, friend!” Breathless, at
length, she joined him.</p>

<p>“T’anks, lady,” said the boy, “you are sure
some stepper.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” said Billee, politely. Billee
was learning slang easily. The boy took one
long look at her, his soul in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Gee!” he said, and turned away.</p>

<p>“Come, let’s get out of this,” urged King.
He saw other young men moving towards
them. “If that boy who put his arm around
you wasn’t Bowery he passes there every day.”</p>

<p>“What of it? He’s all American. I like
his independence.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said King. “On reflection, I
believe I was a little jealous.”</p>

<p>“He is the most direct young man I ever
met. I told him I was married and he
promptly called me a liar.”</p>

<p>Billee found a tired woman sitting in the
sand, a tousled baby in her lap. She dropped
down by her.</p>

<p>“Let me hold him, a little, won’t you,
please?” The mother’s gaze rested on her
face but an instant.</p>

<p>“Guess I will,” she said. “I want to go
somewhere and eat something. My husband
hasn’t come yet.” Billee took the baby, whose
great eyes questioned her.</p>

<p>“Look, King, what beauty-brown eyes!”</p>

<p>“Mind your dress,” he cautioned. “He’s
pretty well messed up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I never had a chance to be
a baby in the sand and smear my nose. I love
him, King, just as he is.” She cuddled him up
in her arms and hummed a lullaby, of the kind
all women inherit and all babies understand.
He was asleep when the mother came back.
King’s eyes were in the sunset. One rose cloud
had shaped itself into a cottage and there was
a gate and a girl leaning over—then Billee
woke him.</p>

<p>And the great round moon came up—the
moon that made the moonlight where things
happened that people were not to be blamed
for. And Billee challenged King for a swim.</p>

<p>In rented bath suit, King waited for her.
She came, such a vision of loveliness as Coney
Island in all its glory had seldom if ever beheld.
For Billee had the light, slender figure
of Ariel and was clad in the conventional two-piece
suit of a boy.</p>

<p>“Billee! For heaven’s sake, go back! or
get in the water quick!”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter, King?” she said,
puzzled, and then glancing down. “It is a
little short and tight, but the girl in the store
said it would fit. I couldn’t try it on. You
ought to know that.”</p>

<p>“But it’s a boy’s suit!”</p>

<p>“Of course. Did you think I was going to
put on one of those skirt things to swim in?
I have too much sense for that. I’m going
swimming, not promenading, King. And I’m
surprised at you. That’s false modesty. If
you are going to be ugly and—and—and look
at me like I was name—name—named William,
and spoil my holiday—” Her voice
began to tremble.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Billee. Of course it isn’t
your fault—ever. Come on, let’s get in the
water.”</p>

<p>Once in the water, King’s amazement was
complete, and delight unbounded. Billee
could not only swim, but swim along with him.
It takes a swimmer to keep along with a
Georgia islander in salt water. Her far-reaching
overhand and under stroke was wonderfully
graceful and effective. She glided
through the water with that seal-like ease so
seldom seen, but oftener in woman than in
man. King was beside her, measuring stroke
with stroke, her radiant face flashing up in
the moonlight, her cheek level with the water.</p>

<p>“How did you learn that, girl? It’s wonderful!
wonderful!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“A woman, one of the world’s great swimmers,
taught me,” she said, “and to wear this
kind of suit. Come, let’s get in deep water.”
King was already on his way to deep water.
Presently he felt himself falling behind a little,
and then he realized that as long as it
lasted her speed was more than equal to his
best.</p>

<p>“Great, isn’t it, King?” she breathed softly.
“Friend or enemy, the ocean is always great.”</p>

<p>Their course was straight out; the last
bather was passed.</p>

<p>“Careful, sir,” called a lifeguard, “the
tide’ll be turning soon.”</p>

<p>“Right O!” sang King. “But old Father
Atlantic and I are chums!”</p>

<p>“Show me how you float,” said Billee, resting
on slow strokes, “I could never learn to
float. My head <i>will</i> go under!” King rolled
over on his back and stretched his arms ahead.
He lay like a piece of driftwood, pointing seaward.
Wave after wave lifted him; combers
broke over, but still the figure floated on without
effort of its own. She decided to try it
once more. It seemed so easy, and so absurd
that he could do it without effort and she fail.</p>

<p>But she only succeeded in getting thoroughly
weary. Try as she might, her little
head would sink. Then a big comber found
her cross-wise in the trough of the sea and
proceeded to roll and pound her unmercifully
and stand her on her head. She came up
gasping from an unknown depth, and struggled
frantically. King heard a smothered cry.</p>

<p>“Steady, Billee!” he yelled. “Coming!
Coming!” His arms literally tore the resisting
water from his path. She caught his
shoulder with one hand, gasping. He had
turned instantly on his back, prepared for the
struggle.</p>

<p>“Rest your weight on me, Billee!—both
hands!—<i>both hands!</i>” he shouted. (You have
to be positive with panicky people.) “Let
your body float free!”</p>

<p>“Help me, King—I’m—I’m—”</p>

<p>“Steady, girl! Are you really all in?”</p>

<p>“So far”—she choked, “but I’m—I’m—”
Gurgle.</p>

<p>“No, you’re not!”</p>

<p>“I am!—I am!—I am!—Oh!—Oh!—”</p>

<p>“Don’t lose your nerve, child!”</p>

<p>“Nerve!” screamed Billee, “it isn’t my
nerve!—I’m losing!—I’m losing—” But
water filled her mouth.</p>

<p>“What? What?”</p>

<p>“King!—string—come loose! I’m—I’m
losin—!” (Shriek.) “Most gone! King,
you’ve got—got to tie—that—that—string!
You’ve got to! Got to! Got to!”</p>

<p>Woman’s wail on lonely ocean! Saddest
sound in the world.</p>

<p>“Then-rest-both-hands-on-my-shoulders!”
he said grimly, setting his jaws hard.</p>

<p>“I can’t—I can’t—I can’t rest—but one!
I’m holding the string! Oh, King! hurry—they’re
most—”</p>

<p>“Steady now, Billee! Hold fast! Steady!”</p>

<p>And King tied the string!</p>

<p>For an age the great ocean had swallowed
him up. But he tied the string!</p>

<p>Billee’s face went down on his breast when
he recovered breath. And there it stuck.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Billee. It’s all right.” Billee
was not worrying. She was laughing and
choking and gurgling. Presently came a note
of alarm:</p>

<p>“King.” Her cheek was against his breast.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Your heart is racing—just racing. Swimming
isn’t good for you. It might stop!”</p>

<p>“Entitled to stop,” he said. “Strong heart
to stand this wild night at sea.” And then,
gently, “Beating only for you now, Billee.”
Silence again. Then her whisper:</p>

<p>“King, you awake?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know, Billee. Hope so.”</p>

<p>“Was this the way you saved the little
girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Cheek right here, where mine is?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Poor little kid! I wonder if she remembers!
Hand on your shoulder, like mine?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“King, love her, please! I hate to think of
that little, lonesome girl, floating around with
you there—and maybe loving you always—and
you forgetting her!”</p>

<p>“Always loved her, Billee. Always shall.
Loved her on the train coming up from Georgia
with the old nurse. I had left my one
little sister sleeping under the liveoaks. She
looked like her. Went out on the deck that
night, not to see the lights—I was afraid she
might fall in the water.”</p>

<p>“Oh!—Oh!—Oh!” wailed Billee.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Cry—cry—crying—a little, I guess,
King.”</p>

<p>“Don’t cry.”</p>

<p>“But it breaks—my heart!”</p>

<p>“Why, what is it?” Silence. And then:</p>

<p>“Floating around, like this, King. It’s awful!
Floating around in the ocean, this a-way.
And no chaperone!”</p>

<p>“Except the moon.”</p>

<p>“And not—engaged, even!”</p>

<p>“Awful, Billee!”</p>

<p>“King, can you float with only one hand
behind you, like you did that night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Beautiful, without either.”</p>

<p>“Lend me one—up here, please—the left
one.” He gave her the hand, much puzzled.
Slipping from his finger the little circlet of
gold, she placed it on her own, in silence. And
in silence her cheek lay again on his breast.</p>

<p>“Billee,” he whispered, in awe, “Billee!”
Then she lifted herself a little and Father
Ocean, with a deep intake of breath, lifted her
a little more. Only her finger tips touched his
shoulders; her body floated free. She hovered
over him as Psyche over the sleeping
god, her lips, one moment, on his: “Just
sweethearts,” she whispered, and was gone.</p>

<p>King never forgot the picture that followed.
Try as he might, he could not overtake
her. Into and out of the waves, over and
under, she fled, a moonbeam, a silver fish.
Once, for a single, marvelous moment, she
sprung half out of the foam crest of a giant
roller, her face turned back, her fallen hair
strewn around it. A hand was lifted, beckoning.
Then, a white flash, and down the slope
beyond she vanished.</p>

<p>“The ideal!” he murmured, “the ideal!”
He followed. He had been following all
his life.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter VIII</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NOW that Fate had gotten her stride,
things moved fast. King was in the
office of Mr. Church checking up
some plans, when the great banker, Throckmorton,
was ushered in by Mr. Beeker in
person. He did not look up. He was more
than a little sore that so long a time should
have elapsed since his plans went into the
banker’s hands without a decision having
been arrived at. So much depended on those
plans.</p>

<p>Mr. Throckmorton’s visit was an event of
note. He usually sent for the men he wanted
to see; he did not visit. Mr. Church was on
his feet instantly. The visitor did not take the
proffered seat but began with bluff geniality:</p>

<p>“So, it was you, Mr. Church, who designed
our memorial window! Mrs. Vandilever was
my sister, you know—I am glad to meet you
in person. I want to consult with reference to
some changes in the Vandilever residence and
the possible use of certain features of the window.
Those little faces—”</p>

<p>“That was one of the firm’s designs, Mr.
Throckmorton”—King’s presence had forced
his hand—“I can’t claim the credit. Individuals
don’t count here. It’s the old newspaper
‘we,’ you know.”</p>

<p>“But I want to consult the actual artist—the
creator—for a special reason, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir. Oh, Mr. Dubignon, you
originated the general idea in the Vandilever
window, did you not?” Mr. Church turned
with a show of indifference to the draughtsman,
who now looked up, a slight smile on
his lips.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “and the details, also, if I
remember right.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Dubignon, you here? Glad to meet
you again,” said the banker, to the profound
amazement of Mr. Church. “I have a mind
to tear away the hall glass around home for
something that tells a story. Can you run
around this evening for a little professional
talk? Shall want the same child faces you
used in the church. They closely resemble a
niece of mine who is to be with us Christmas,
and I am planning a surprise. Come at eight
thirty.”</p>

<p>And promptly at eight thirty, as testified
by little chimes in the great hallway, King entered
the home of the great banker—fairyland,
it seemed.</p>

<p>Back in his own room, an hour later, he sat
and stared out over the white city, as one who
had dreamed an exquisite dream and could
not clear his eyes of it. He had been employed,
or the firm he served had, through
him, to compose a strange picture in glass—a
picture of remarkable significance for him.
What an exquisite comedy! The commission
was <i>carte blanche</i> as to price and the central
figure was to be himself—humble draughtsman!
It was too much for his sense of humor.
He threw back his head and laughed long and
loud. Oh, for ten minutes of Billee! Where
the deuce was Billee, anyway? And why
didn’t Mr. Throckmorton talk about the plans
he already had? He had casually, he hoped
it sounded that way, inquired of him as to
how the office building matter was coming on,
and had been told, casually, it certainly
sounded that way, that he hadn’t got a report
yet.</p>

<p>Fate moved again. Fate had certainly
waked up. This time she moved a castle.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Dubignon.” King took the
nearest chair, a little weakly. It was his first
summons to the senior partner’s room. Now
that man of business leaned back from his
desk and surveyed him with interest. What
had happened? And then:</p>

<p>“I have reported favorably on the plans
you submitted to Throckmorton. They are
fine. A man doesn’t have to plan but one such
building to make good. Dubignon, you are
wasted in stained glass. Throckmorton informs
me that he will accept the plans and
finance the building. The firm of Beeker,
Toomer &amp; Dubignon will erect it.” He pushed
a paper across the desk for King to sign, and
proffered a pen.</p>

<p>“Sir!”</p>

<p>“Rather sudden, I know; but Toomer and
I have bought out Church and you are in.
There are no details. The building you bring
in settles all.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir, but I think I should like to
go out and faint awhile.”</p>

<p>“Go when you please. Partners don’t ask
permission. Hunt <i>her</i> up, my boy, and tell
her about it. There’s always a ‘her’ in a
young man’s life. There was in mine.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is, sir, I don’t know where my
‘her’ is. I seem to have lost her.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother. She’ll turn up. They always
do. Here, you are going without signing the
papers.” King signed, and shook hands fervently.</p>

<p>Mr. Beeker drew a box of Havanas from
his desk and taking one shoved the others
across to him.</p>

<p>“Tell me the truth, Dubignon”—his face
was full of smiles and he leaned back, cutting
the cigar—“did you put those plans across on
old Throckmorton before he had decided to
put up any building at all?”</p>

<p>“I believe so, sir.”</p>

<p>“And you refused to alter your plans to
suit his frontage—made him buy $269,000
worth more?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t change the proportions, sir, to
fit his frontage. It would have cut my building
to thirty stories.” Mr. Beeker looked at
him affectionately.</p>

<p>“My boy, will you mind if I tell you the
difference between a crank and a genius?”</p>

<p>“Of course not, sir.”</p>

<p>“A genius is a crank who has succeeded.
You’ve had a narrow escape.”</p>

<p>But King went back half blind with excitement
to his office to find that a postman had
left some letters, and Terence, good old Terence,
had placed one with a zigzag address
on top. It was more of a jumping than a running
hand, and had become associated in the
mind of the observant Irish lad with dollar
tips. It was from Billee in California. The
old lady had carried her off to Los Angeles
and she hadn’t said goodbye because she knew
she would cry on the street, and would he
please forgive her, she was so unhappy. And,
yes, she was coming home soon; and the little
circle in the letter was made by running a
pencil around a certain ring. She had laid a
kiss in the circle and hoped it wouldn’t fall
out. The spot on the paper close by? She had
forgotten to wipe her eyes. All this and more.</p>

<p>The cicada wears his homely brown suit
seven years, and rambles around in the dark
underground, perfectly content. Then something
happens to him inside and he comes up,
crawls on a limb and presently splits his suit
wide open down the back. Now he is out with
iridescent wings, a guitar under his arm, and
life is one long, sweet summer dream.</p>

<p>New York was getting uncomfortably small
for King Dubignon. The world itself didn’t
feel too large.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Then the window at the end of the Throckmorton
hall was finished by the factory and
skilled workmen placed it. King went around
by appointment to view it Christmas eve with
the arc light of the street shining through, the
hall lights dimmed. It represented a river
night scene, New York’s skyline in the distance
and the stars above. On the water in
the foreground floated a boy and on his breast
lay the face of a sleeping child, her arms
clasping his shoulders. A beam of light disclosed
the two faces. In design, in execution,
in effect, it was admirable. Even King, sitting
off up the hallway with Mr. Throckmorton,
for the perspective, could find no fault,
though, naturally, modesty checked pride.</p>

<p>And then to King Dubignon came the shock
by which all other emotions measured as
tremors. It was as though lightning had descended
on his uncovered head. For a lady’s
maid, in cap and apron, stood by Mr. Throckmorton,
saying:</p>

<p>“A call, sir, at the private phone.” And
that maid was Billee. She saw him as he
swayed to his feet, and drew back timidly,
lifting a warning hand behind the banker’s
vanishing form.</p>

<p>“Billee!” he gasped. “You! You!” He
rushed toward her, but she side-stepped hurriedly,
whispering:</p>

<p>“Don’t, King! Think of what you are
doing! This house, a waiting maid! It’s ruin
for you! Don’t spoil all! And think of me!”
He hesitated and sank groaning into a chair.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of you,” he said weakly.</p>

<p>“Are you so sorry for me as that?” she
said, standing with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>“Sorry? Sorry for you? Just wait till I get
you outside. Sorry? Child, we’ve got the
biggest thing coming you ever dreamed of!
I am full partner in the firm now. It’s Beeker,
Toomer &amp; Dubignon. I’ve made good! Have
you seen the evening papers? Every notable
piece of work I have done for New York is
mentioned; there is a picture of my office
building, and all about my family. Billee, the
world is mine, and you are the most wonderful
thing in it!”</p>

<p>“But I—I am only—” she glanced down at
her dress. “Oh, King, you are beyond me
now. You won’t need Billee any more.”</p>

<p>“Need you! I’ve made good for two,” he
shouted, “and Billee is the other one.” Billee’s
hands were behind her. Now, slowly they
were withdrawn, bringing away the apron
and revealing the simple short dress of a
child. The little cap of the housemaid was
lifted, and from beneath it fell down a long
plait of hair, ribboned at the end. She came
slowly and kneeled by him and lifted her face.
Upon it the window shed its tints. She seemed
to float in a golden mist.</p>

<p>“The little dream girl—praying!” he whispered
in awe.</p>

<p>Then with closed eyes she laid her cheek on
his breast, her arms half enfolding him.</p>

<p>“And this one, King?” But King was beyond
further speech.</p>

<p>Doubtingly, reverently he touched the little
head. His lips parted for one long, deep
breath, while the furniture in the room
whirled about him in a most absurd manner.</p>

<p>“Well!” she said, at length, her eyes opening
and mouth curving into the challenging
smile. “I did it of my own free will. Why
don’t you?”</p>

<p>Again the inevitable happened, but this
time Billee did not struggle nor King ask forgiveness.</p>

<p>“Oh, King!” she whispered gently, freeing
herself at length and taking his face between
her soft hands, “my splendid boy-man, you
said you’d come back when you were famous,
didn’t you? King, all that my father, my
mother had are mine—this house—everything—mine
and yours. It’s our Christmas!
Let’s always be ‘just sweethearts’.”</p>

<p>An old man who was peeping in at the door
drew a deep breath, smiled and went back to
his den and chair to pick up a paper wherein
was a noble building of thirty-five stories. But
his eyes closed over it, the room blurred, and
his head sank back among the cushions. It
was May in New England and the bees and
apple blossoms were there, and green fields
and the song birds and a little sister with the
lovelight in her eyes.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
